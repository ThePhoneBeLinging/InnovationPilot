What do you need more knowledge about?
===

What research will you do - Who do you need to talk to and how will you do it?
===

<!-- pause -->

Who?

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- We need to research what motivation has caused people to take charge 
(pun intended) of producing their own energy.

- From both sides we need to listen to concerns regarding taking that initial step.

- From people who don't produce any energy, we need to fully find the root cause

<!-- pause -->

How?

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- We have chosen Gunds√∏magle as a test city, choosing a city allows us to automate a simple script that sends all inhabitants an email with a questionnaire. The city is also small enough for us to simply manually send emails

- All of these interviews should be conducted with the 5 why's in mind

- Use the knowledge from this, to create a plan for convincing more people to become more energy-independent. Also estimate actual offer to make it more real for people
